                The Filix School of Education is an educational project that was
                set up by Nanritam, one of our other partners. The aim of this
                project is to provide an English-medium educational experience
                for students in a remote, rural area in India. They believe that
                not only developing the literacy of children is important in
                India, but being able to gain an education with western teaching
                methods allows for the students of the Filix School to have
                opportunities that they otherwise wouldn't have. We have teamed
                up with the Filix school to help provide an English-medium
                education to children in rural India to help increase their
                literacy and to open up new opportunities to them.
